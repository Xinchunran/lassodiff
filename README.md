# LassoDiff Inference

## Project Goals
- All-atom lasso peptide modeling under a backbone + isobond flow matching framework
- Pocket ligand-conditioned all-atom lasso peptide prediction
- De novo all-atom design of lasso peptides

## Current Progress
- Integrated and organized core inference flow matching modules
- Added loss computation and feature processing for backbone and isobond constraints
- Completed adaptation paths and attribution statements for Protenix and ml-simplefold

## Next Steps
- Complete the feature pipeline for pocket ligand-conditioned inputs
- Evaluate stability and usability of all-atom prediction and de novo design workflows
- Build a minimal reproducible inference pipeline and evaluation metrics

## Acknowledgements
- Thanks to Protenix for the model architecture and engineering implementation
- Thanks to ml-simplefold for key modules and engineering references
